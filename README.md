Hi, this is a welcome introduction to my new company / organization I made recently 26/04/2021 it established.
The way this is going to work is this company is going to be giving people a help in hand, obviously a free charge as we are 'helping' not going to spoon-feed obviously, but please use common sense.
                         
The rules are following:

1. Use common sense
2. Please don't beg for staff / administrator within pohable.
3. DO NOT CHARGE ANYONE, THIS IS A FREE HELP IN-HAND SERVICE.


FINALLY LASTLY.

Please take great care with this opportunity as it's once in a life time, I suppose? I don't really care what you do.
